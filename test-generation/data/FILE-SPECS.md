# Specifications of data files

## `generated/<configuration_id>-test-generation-data.csv`

File automatically generated by the [`../../utils/scripts/collect-data.sh`](../../utils/scripts/collect-data.sh) script which has gathered all data generated by any test generator tool.

Despite the many columns in the `.csv` file, the most relevant are:

- `configuration_id`: Name of the test generation configuration
  * factor, i.e., , e.g., `vanilla`

- `group_id`: Full bug identifier composed by `project_name`-`bug_id`
  * factor, e.g, `Chart-1`

- `Random_Seed`: Seed used in the test generation procedure
  * numeric, e.g., 3

- `TARGET_CLASS`: Name of the class under test
  * factor, e.g., `org.jfree.chart.renderer.category.AbstractCategoryItemRenderer`

- `Size`: Number of test cases generated by the test generator tool
  * numeric, e.g., 42

- `Length`: Number of statements in the generated test suite
  * numeric, e.g., 133

- `LineCoverage`: Line coverage achieved by the generated test suite
  * numeric, e.g., 0.6

- `LineCoverageBitString`: Line coverage achieved by the generated test suite in a bit string format
  * factor, e.g., 0010001

- `BranchCoverage`: Branch coverage achieved by the generated test suite
  * numeric, e.g., 0.2

- `BranchCoverageBitString`: Branch coverage achieved by the generated test suite in a bit string format
  * factor, e.g., 0110101

- `ExceptionCoverage`: Exception coverage achieved by the generated test suite
  * numeric, e.g., 0.9

- `ExceptionCoverageBitString`: Exception coverage achieved by the generated test suite in a bit string format
  * factor, e.g., 0111111

- `WeakMutationScore`: (Weak) Mutation score achieved by the generated test suite
  * numeric, e.g., 0.4

- `WeakMutationCoverageBitString`: (Weak) Mutation score achieved by the generated test suite in a bit string format
  * factor, e.g., 0011

- `OutputCoverage`: Output coverage achieved by the generated test suite
  * numeric, e.g., 0.6

- `OutputCoverageBitString`: Output coverage achieved by the generated test suite in a bit string format
  * factor, e.g., 0010001

- `MethodCoverage`: Method coverage achieved by the generated test suite
  * numeric, e.g., 0.3

- `MethodCoverageBitString`: Method coverage achieved by the generated test suite in a bit string format
  * factor, e.g., 0010001

- `MethodNoExceptionCoverage`: Method-no-Exception coverage achieved by the generated test suite
  * numeric, e.g., 0.1

- `MethodNoExceptionCoverageBitString`: Method-no-Exception coverage achieved by the generated test suite in a bit string format
  * factor, e.g., 0010000

- `CBranchCoverage`: CBranch coverage achieved by the generated test suite
